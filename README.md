[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/468080187.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/468080187)

This code is for the topology optimization of porous electrodes. It was used to produce the results in [Roy et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12059). Please see the paper for more details.

LLNL Release Number: LLNL-CODE-832425

## Requirements
