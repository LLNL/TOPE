# Topology Optimization for Porous Electrodes (TOPE) 

This code is for the topology optimization of porous electrodes. It was used to produce the results in [Roy et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12059). Please see the paper for more details.

## Requirements

Please install the open-source finite element library [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html), and the MMA optimization package [pyMMAopt](https://github.com/LLNL/pyMMAopt). For automation of bash jobs, we use [signac-flow](https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow) (0.12.0).
