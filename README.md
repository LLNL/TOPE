# Topology Optimization for Porous Electrodes (TOPE) 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/468080187.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/468080187)

This code is for the topology optimization of porous electrodes. It was used to produce the results in [Roy et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-022-03249-2). Please see the paper for more details.

LLNL Release Number: LLNL-CODE-832425

## Requirements

Please install the open-source finite element library [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html), and the MMA optimization package [pyMMAopt](https://github.com/LLNL/pyMMAopt). For automation of bash jobs, we use [signac-flow](https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow) (0.12.0).
